```

## 🛠️ Key Commands

```bash
yarn dev              # Start development server
yarn build            # Build for production
yarn generate-tabs    # Generate code display tabs
yarn lint            # Run ESLint
```

## 📖 Documentation

Components are stored under `/components/library`. Each component has:

- **Preview**: The rendered component example
- **Code Tabs**: Actual source code files (auto-generated)
- **Copy Button**: One-click copy to clipboard

### Auto-Generated Code Display

This project uses an automated system for displaying code:

1. Create `tabs.config.json` listing files to show
2. Run `yarn generate-tabs` to read files and generate display code
3. Code tabs automatically show your actual component source

No manual copy/paste or string duplication needed!

## 🎨 Component Guidelines

Components should:
- Use Polaris components primarily
- Follow Polaris design patterns
- Be copy/paste friendly (prefer inline styles)
- Include clear usage examples
- Work standalone in other projects

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for full guidelines.
